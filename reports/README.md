Files in directory:
* Forest_Species.ipynb - Solution file. After fully finished working, the notebook will create models in the directory
* Report - Report about the practical assignment
* requirement - Third side libraries versions
* DenseNet_log - Logs of the learning process of DenseNet model
* Resnet50 - Logs of the learning process of Resnet50 model

How to use:
Open Jupyter notebook on a machine with GPU or in Google Colab, just run all ceils inside the notebook.
The notebook will download archives with datasets, unzip images, save their reshaped versions.
After the training process, in a directory will appear logs about the learning process and pytorch models.
